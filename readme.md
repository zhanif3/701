### Compilation
To compile Mori, the user will need a copy of the source repository and a Rust compiler. Mori has been built on Mac OSX
and Ubuntu Linux 18.04. To compile Mori on Mac OSX, run the following commands in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/zhanif3/701
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
cd 701
cargo build --release
```

To compile Mori on an Ubuntu machine, run the following commands in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/zhanif3/701
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
cd 701
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
cargo build --release
```

The result of these commands is functionally the same - a series of compiled binaries will be created within the
target/release directory. After this has been done, an example of Mori can be executed by running:

```
target/release/all_in_one other_data/10000_dna TTAGAGAAA
```

Which will run the `all_in_one` binary over a specifed file, with `TTAGAGAAA` as the search string. The expected output
is below:

```
5, 61, 208, 7, "TTAGAGAAA", "other_data/10000_dna"
```

Serialization functionality can be demonstrated as well:

```
target/release/generator other_data/10000_dna
```

This command will write several serialized files to the current directory, 


Installation From Scratch:

scp -i ~/Downloads/personal_aws_dev.pem src/*_dna ubuntu@ec2-18-191-11-247.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:

git clone https://github.com/zhanif3/701
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
cd 701
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
cargo build --release

For the class project, I am most interested to implement the Burrows-Wheeler transform in a high performance language (in this case, Rust). In implementing this, I would focus on steps taken to improve the speed of computation over large DNA strings, and specifically seek to write about optimizations both algorithmic and implementation based used to improve the speed of the program. In addition to this, I would also implement search capabilities over the compressed string via a network interface via a cloud provider. From there, I would like to explore methods of compressing and sharing that transformed data, thereby providing a means for other users to easily transfer their datasets in a pre-transformed format. This has obvious applications for users who wish to serve their data over the aforementioned network interface.

I will be working alone, and have attempted to scope the project against that. If there is a desire for an expansion of scope, or cautions that would lead to a reduction in scope, I am happy to discuss.
